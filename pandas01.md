# Pandas

## Series and Dataframes

Series and dataframes form the core data model for Pandas in Python. The data sets are first read into these dataframes and then various operations (e.g. group by, aggregation etc.) can be applied very easily to its columns.

### Series
Series can be understood as a 1 dimensional labelled / indexed array. You can access individual elements of this series through these labels.

### Dataframes

A dataframe is similar to Excel workbook â€“ you have column names referring to columns and you have rows, which can be accessed with use of row numbers. The essential difference being that column names and row numbers are known as column and row index, in case of dataframes.
